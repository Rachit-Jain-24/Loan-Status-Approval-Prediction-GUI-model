# Loan Status Approval Streamlit App

# Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts loan approval status using a machine learning model. The app provides a simple and user-friendly interface where users can input their financial details, and the trained model determines whether their loan application is likely to be approved or not.

# Features
1. Web-Based Interface: The application is built using Streamlit, allowing users to access it from any device with a web browser.
2. Machine Learning Model: Optimized using Logistic Regression, the model predicts loan approval status based on user-provided data.
3. Optimized Model Performance: Hyperparameter tuning and feature scaling have been applied to enhance model accuracy and efficiency.
4. Real-Time Predictions: Instant predictions based on user inputs.
5. Secure and Reliable: The model ensures accuracy and fairness in loan predictions.

# How It Works
The user enters financial and personal details such as income, loan amount, credit score, and employment details.
The machine learning model processes the input and predicts whether the loan application will be approved or denied.
The result is displayed instantly on the Streamlit web app.

# Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit (for GUI development)
Scikit-Learn (for machine learning model)
Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)
Joblib (for model deployment)
